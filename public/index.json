Introduction # The Warranty Project is being developed by me during my third semester of Computer Science. The Project aims to help people keep track of their warranties at any given time without having to worry about paper. At first I was not sure what to build but at some point I came with the idea since I was not very good at keeping track of my own warranties at some point and this project is for my own sanity in a sense. So that I never have to look at paper again.\nObjectives:\nDigitize the process of keeping track of warranties Ensure that users can keep track of warranties if anything were to happen Model a real site that people can view, which is automated after registering a product Implement a maintainable, scalable architecture for further improvements 2. Background # Warrantour aims to keep track of products, warranties and receipts.\nNormally you would have to keep track of:\nWhere did I throw the receipt? When does my warranty expire? Calculating when the expiration expires. Always having to fiddle with or look for warranties on E-mail or paper. Project goal: Automate this process so the mundane task of keeping overview and remembering isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue.\n3. Business Understanding # Customer Journey:\nRegister Products While registering products, register warranty date and receipt View products on profile Delete or keep products with warranties that have expired Business Requirements:\nWarranty expiry date calculated by purchase date and warranty expiry date Purchase date cannot be changed after registering a product Expired warranties are read-only Only the owner has access to product- and warranty data Week One # Week Two # Week Three # Week Four # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/warranty/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Warranty","type":"posts"}]
