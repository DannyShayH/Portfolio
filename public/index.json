[{"content":" Week One # The Idea # As mentioned in the introduction, on the third semester we had to personally choose a project to work on in Java backend where we have to implement the use of Hibernate and JPA. With that being said, the idea stems from my lack of tracking warranties and just plainly being lazy as one might say.\nProgress:\nMy progress throughout the blog will mainly be written in a bullet poitnt form to make it easy and simple to understand where I\u0026rsquo;m at, and perhaps every once in a while I\u0026rsquo;ll add a few images so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to visualize.\nWrote a document with what I would need for the project to work. Figured out which Entities I needed for my project (User, Product, Warranty, Receipt). Created Intellij-project, used a template we made in class with hibernate already implemented. Created a repository on github and connected it to my intellij project. Created portfolio repository and worked on learning markdown in Visual Studio Code. After feedback from my teacher I constructed a Domain Model and a Class Diagram which looks as follows: Reasoning:\nKeep my Entities simple. User has a product, warrant and receipt. The fields were filled as placeholders for the time being. Most of my focus was on the portfolio (Markdown) to set it all up.

He came to the conclusion that I need to add an extra entity so that my project would have some more to offer rather than the initial 4 entities I had. I worked with what he had in mind.\nProgress:\nLooked back at my document and added a ProductRegistration entity. Implemented it into my intellij project and gave it it\u0026rsquo;s respective annotations. Gave ProductRegistration relation to Product. Gave Product relation to Warranty. Set up all of my DAO\u0026rsquo;s to my respective entities. Added IDAO Interface with given methods for all of my DAO\u0026rsquo;s. Updated Domain Model and yet to update Class Diagram. Again updated Domain Model after feed back. Gave Warranty relation to Product. Reasoning:\nAdded ProductRegistration. Registration is the User\u0026rsquo;s Action. Would be awkward to add userId directly to product. Can register multiple of the same product. Better view of what entity owns which entity. Helps link User and Product when Registering a product.

Introduction # The Warranty Project is being developed by me during my third semester of Computer Science. The Project aims to help people keep track of their warranties at any given time without having to worry about paper. At first I was not sure what to build, but I to the conclusion that I was not very good at keeping track of my own warranties at some point and this project is for my own sanity in a sense. So that I never have to look at paper again.\nObjectives:\nDigitize the process of keeping track of warranties Ensure that users can keep track of warranties if anything were to happen Model a real site that people can view, which is automated after registering a product Implement a maintainable, scalable architecture for further improvements 2. Background # Warrantour aims to keep track of products, warranties and receipts.\nNormally you would have to keep track of:\nWhere did I throw the receipt? When does my warranty expire? Calculating when the expiration expires. Always having to fiddle with or look for warranties on E-mail or paper. Project goal: Automate this process so the mundane task of keeping overview and remembering isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue.\n3. Business Understanding # Customer Journey:\nRegister Products While registering products, register warranty date and receipt View products on profile Delete or keep products with warranties that have expired Business Requirements:\nWarranty expiry date calculated by purchase date and warranty expiry date Purchase date cannot be changed after registering a product Expired warranties are read-only Only the owner has access to product- and warranty data ","date":"3 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/warranty/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Warranty - Introduction","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
