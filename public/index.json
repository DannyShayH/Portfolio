[{"content":" Week One # The Idea # As mentioned in the introduction, on the third semester we had to personally choose a project to work on in Java backend where we have to implement the use of Hibernate and JPA. With that being said, the idea stems from my lack of tracking warranties and just plainly being lazy as one might say.\nProgress:\nMy progress throughout the blog will mainly be written in a bullet poitnt form to make it easy and simple to understand where I\u0026rsquo;m at, and perhaps every once in a while I\u0026rsquo;ll add a few images so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to visualize.\nWrote a document with what I would need for the project to work. Figured out which Entities I needed for my project (User, Product, Warranty, Receipt). Created Intellij-project, used a template we made in class with hibernate already implemented. Created a repository on github and connected it to my intellij project. Created portfolio repository and worked on learning markdown in Visual Studio Code. After feedback from my teacher I constructed a Domain Model and a Class Diagram which looks as follows: Reasoning:\nKeep my Entities simple. User has a product, warrant and receipt. The fields were filled as placeholders for the time being. Most of my focus was on the portfolio (Markdown) to set it all up.

He came to the conclusion that I need to add an extra entity so that my project would have some more to offer rather than the initial 4 entities I had. I worked with what he had in mind.\nProgress:\nLooked back at my document and added a ProductRegistration entity. Implemented it into my intellij project and gave it it\u0026rsquo;s respective annotations. Gave ProductRegistration relation to Product. Gave Product relation to Warranty. Set up all of my DAO\u0026rsquo;s to my respective entities. Added IDAO Interface with given methods for all of my DAO\u0026rsquo;s. Updated Domain Model and yet to update Class Diagram. Again updated Domain Model after feed back. Gave Warranty relation to Product. Reasoning:\nAdded ProductRegistration. Registration is the User\u0026rsquo;s Action. Would be awkward to add userId directly to product. Can register multiple of the same product. Better view of what entity owns which entity. Helps link User and Product when Registering a product.

His advice: Remember to log more to make sure no details go lost.\nProgress:\nAdded a PasswordService that hashes a user\u0026rsquo;s password. Used BCrypt library to achieve hashing. public String hash(String password){ return BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt()); } public boolean verify(String password, String hash){ return BCrypt.checkpw(password, hash); } Started working on how to use API Added a XMLExtractor to get data from API Used our HttpClient made together in class but altered it to take an XML file instead of a Json file.\nprivate static final HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient(); public static String getXml(String url) throws IOException, InterruptedException, URISyntaxException { HttpRequest request = HttpRequest .newBuilder() .uri(new URI(url)) .header(\u0026#34;Accept\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;) .GET() .build(); HttpResponse\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; response = client .send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()); if (response.statusCode() == 200) { return response.body(); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Error in: \u0026#34; + response.statusCode()); } return null; } Created a class that uses DocumentBuilder library to extract and parse XML files, and returns it into my LawDataDTO object.\npublic static LawDataDTO extract(String xml) throws IOException, SAXException, ParserConfigurationException { DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder(); Document doc = builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xml))); String title = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; NodeList titleNodes = doc.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#34;DocumentTitle\u0026#34;); if(titleNodes.getLength() \u0026gt; 0){ title = titleNodes.item(0).getTextContent(); } NodeList textNodes = doc.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#34;Char\u0026#34;); StringBuilder warrantyText = new StringBuilder(); for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; textNodes.getLength(); i++){ String text = textNodes.item(i).getTextContent(); if(text.toLowerCase().contains(\u0026#34;garanti\u0026#34;)){ warrantyText.append(text).append(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\u0026#34;); } } return new LawDataDTO(title, warrantyText.toString()); } Created a IRetrieveDAO interface with methods that IRetrieveDAO implements. An example of one of a few IRetrieveDAO implementations that have been created. These methods were used to get specific data out of the database using JPQL queries.\n@Override public Set\u0026lt;Warranty\u0026gt; getAllWarrantiesForUsers(long userId) { try (EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager()) { TypedQuery\u0026lt;Warranty\u0026gt; query = em.createQuery(\u0026#34;SELECT DISTINCT pr.product.warranty \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;FROM ProductRegistration pr \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;WHERE pr.owner.id = :userId\u0026#34;, Warranty.class); query.setParameter(\u0026#34;userId\u0026#34;, userId); return new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(query.getResultList()); } } Reasoning:\nAdded password hashing to demonstrate, I\u0026rsquo;m able to hash passwords using BCrypt. While working with retsinformation.dk API, I realised that they use XML and not Json. Worked with DocumentBuilder library. Created a XML Extractor method to extract from the API. While this API does not work well with this project, it still shows some sort of determination of implementation. Plan for next week # Planning to use another API. SendGrid to implement a notification system for the project. This API will work in favor with my program while using Cron job. User\u0026rsquo;s receive a notification, of when their warranty expires. Either for 1 month, 1 week, 3 days.\n","date":"3 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/warranty/week3/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Week 3","type":"posts"},{"content":" Week Four # ","date":"3 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/warranty/week4/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Week 4","type":"posts"},{"content":" Hey I\u0026rsquo;m Daniel, Some Call Me Shay # My journey into tech started when I was younger, fascinated by computers — mostly games, because I didn’t know any better at the time.

Introduction # The Warranty Project is being developed by me during my third semester of Computer Science. The Project aims to help people keep track of their warranties at any given time without having to worry about paper. At first I was not sure what to build, but I to the conclusion that I was not very good at keeping track of my own warranties at some point and this project is for my own sanity in a sense. So that I never have to look at paper again.\nObjectives:\nDigitize the process of keeping track of warranties Ensure that users can keep track of warranties if anything were to happen Model a real site that people can view, which is automated after registering a product Implement a maintainable, scalable architecture for further improvements 2. Background # Warrantour aims to keep track of products, warranties and receipts.\nNormally you would have to keep track of:\nWhere did I throw the receipt? When does my warranty expire? Calculating when the expiration expires. Always having to fiddle with or look for warranties on E-mail or paper. Project goal: Automate this process so the mundane task of keeping overview and remembering isn\u0026rsquo;t an issue.\n3. Business Understanding # Customer Journey:\nRegister Products While registering products, register warranty date and receipt View products on profile Delete or keep products with warranties that have expired Business Requirements:\nWarranty expiry date calculated by purchase date and warranty expiry date Purchase date cannot be changed after registering a product Expired warranties are read-only Only the owner has access to product- and warranty data ","date":"3 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/warranty/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Warranty - Introduction","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
