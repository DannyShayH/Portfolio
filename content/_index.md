## Hey I'm Daniel, Some Call Me Shay

My journey into tech started when I was younger, fascinated by computers — mostly games, because I didn’t know any better at the time.
Back then, I had no idea how much work, creativity, and passion goes into building technology from scratch.
My first real encounter with code came when I decided to set up my PC with Linux — probably the most chaotic place to begin. It was confusing, frustrating, and overwhelming… but I pushed through.

Safe to say, I survived — and I’m never changing my setup again (mostly joking).

I am an up and coming Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on Frontend Development.
I enjoy building websites from the ground up, creating responsive, accessible, and interactive user experiences. Transforming ideas into clean and functional interfaces is where I thrive the most.

At the same time, I do know how to build backend systems that support performance, scalability, and structure.
