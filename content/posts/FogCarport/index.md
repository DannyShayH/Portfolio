# FOG Carport Project
## Full System Documentation & Development Report

> Comprehensive documentation of the design, development, and implementation of a web-based carport configuration and sales system for FOG.

---

## 1. Introduction
The **FOG Carport project** was developed during the second semester of the Computer Science program.  
It aims to create a **realistic, business-oriented web application** that supports the full lifecycle of selling carports, from customer configuration to seller pricing and approval.

**Objectives:**
- Digitize the carport configuration and sales process
- Ensure data consistency and historical record-keeping
- Model a real business workflow with both automation and human oversight
- Implement a maintainable, scalable architecture

---

## 2. Background
FOG sells both **standard** and **custom-built carports**.  
Historically, the custom carports required:

- Manual configuration and measurements
- Seller-side validation and pricing
- PDF and drawing generation by hand
- No unified digital workflow

**Project goal:** Automate this process while maintaining strict validation and accurate documentation.

## 3. Business Understanding
**Customer Journey:**

1. Browse carport products  
2. Configure a custom carport or select a standard one  
3. Submit a request  
4. Seller reviews and modifies offer  
5. Customer receives final offer and accepts/rejects  

**Business Requirements:**
- Automate configuration and validation
- Allow sellers to review and modify offers
- Ensure material and dimension constraints
- Preserve historical requests for analytics
